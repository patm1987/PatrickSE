This was my freshman year game as well as the first large scale project I had written in C. It never reached full stability, and is extremely difficult to complete without a segfault. I was responsible for the battle system used in the game, and had written the initial graphics code as well as the initial file management code.

Ayilios does not run on Windows Vista due to its use of the command prompt. It requires a working command prompt that can be resized to 50x50 and run in full screen mode. The game is entirely text based.
